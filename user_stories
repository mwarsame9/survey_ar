As a survey designer, I want to create a new survey, so that I can get people's opinion on important matters. (I also want the first letter in all words of a survey title to be capitalized. Hint: callback!)

As a survey designer, I want to add questions to my survey, so that I can find out what people think about various topics.

As a survey designer, I want to update and delete surveys and questions, in case I change my mind about something.
